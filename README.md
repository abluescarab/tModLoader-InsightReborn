Insight Reborn allows you to see the first 8 items in a chest just by mousing over it. Based on shockah's mod Insight.

Now includes the X-Ray Goggles accessory! You can enable/disable needing the goggles in the mod configuration. Craft X-Ray Goggles at a workbench + chair with 2 lenses and 2 rubies.

## Known Issues
* Chest contents stay visible until another tile is moused over
